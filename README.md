# Predicting Sales Opportunities
### General Assembly Capstone Project
by Daryl Cheong

# Introduction
Sales is one of the essential components of any business. It involves the act of selling goods or services to an interested party, in exchange for money. This process allows a business to generate revenue, which is why it is so vital for any organisation. Without sales, a business will not be able to grow or even survive.

Due to the importance of sales, this project will examine the sales process of an organisation and seek to achieve the following goals:-

**Goal 1 - Predict the value of sales opportunity ('Amount' column) using regression models**

**Goal 2 - Predict the outcome of sales opportunity ('Result' column) using classification models**
